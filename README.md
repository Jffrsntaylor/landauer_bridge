# Exploratory Modeling of Information-Driven Vacuum Response

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory theoretical paper investigating whether irreversible information processing, as constrained by Landauer’s principle, could induce a small, transient response in an effective vacuum model.

The work is **conceptual and speculative** in nature. Its purpose is not to claim new physical laws or experimental confirmation, but to explore whether a well-defined, information-theoretic energy input can be modeled consistently within an effective field framework and analyzed for potential detectability.

The paper emphasizes internal consistency, dimensional correctness, and numerical modeling rather than ontological claims.

## Scope and Intent

This work should be read as:

- A **modeling exercise**, not a validated physical theory  
- An exploration of **information → energy → effective mass** relationships under explicit assumptions  
- A demonstration of how speculative ideas can be constrained, parameterized, and tested numerically  

The paper does **not** claim:
- Experimental detection of new phenomena  
- A derivation of gravity from information  
- Violation of established thermodynamic or relativistic principles  

Instead, it asks whether a tightly scoped hypothetical mechanism can be made precise enough to simulate and falsify.

## Methodological Focus

The paper focuses on:
- Effective-field-style modeling of a scalar order parameter
- Boundary value problem (BVP) formulation and numerical solution
- Regime interpolation (elastic vs dissipative response)
- Parameter sensitivity analysis
- Order-of-magnitude detectability estimates under realistic noise assumptions

These techniques are broadly applicable to:
- statistical physics
- signal detection
- stochastic modeling
- Monte Carlo simulation
- machine learning and optimization dynamics

## Status

This work is **pre-experimental** and **incomplete by design**.

Several parameters (e.g., correlation length, relaxation time, coupling strength) are phenomenological and intended to be constrained or rejected by future modeling or experimental analysis.

The value of the work lies primarily in:
- clarifying assumptions
- identifying scaling behavior
- motivating simulation-based follow-up studies

## Relationship to Other Work

Subsequent repositories and scripts derived from this paper focus on:
- Monte Carlo signal simulation
- noise and detectability analysis
- statistical convergence behavior

Those projects intentionally separate **numerical inference** from **physical interpretation**.
